CAPSTONE PROJECT

Descriptions of the contents in folders:

  Literature folder: includes only papers/articles/github code/etc. I read for my project. 

  Input folder: it is split between Raw Data and Final Data. In the Raw Data subfolder I put the raw data (the one I    downloaded from the internet or I got from a third party). In the Final Data subfolder I will save the cleaned data, the one I will use for my analysis

  Script folder: it is split between Data Cleaning, Summary Statistics, Regression Analysis, etc. This is where all my code sit

  Output folder: follows the same structure as the Script folder. 

  Results (or Report) folder: in this folder I added the results (reports) of my work, i.e. final_report.docx; project_objective.docx, data_description.docx; regression_model.docx, regression_results.docx.
